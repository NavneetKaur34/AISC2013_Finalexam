**Salaries Dataset Analysis:**
## Overview of the Dataset:
Employee salaries, years of experience, and job titles are all included in the salaries dataset. It is made up of multiple columns, including:
Salary: A numerical column that represents employee pay.
YearsExperience: A numeric column indicating the number of years of experience of personnel.
JobTitle: A categorical column containing employee job titles.

# Visualization
## Salary Histogram
A histogram was built to depict the salary distribution among employees. This graph depicts the range and frequency distribution of salary values.

## Salaries are plotted in a boxplot.
The boxplot depicts the distribution of pay numbers, highlighting any outliers and the central tendency of salaries.

## Job Titles Bar Chart
A bar chart was created to represent the number of distinct job titles held by employees. This image aids in comprehending the distribution of job titles in the dataset.

## Scatterplot: Salary vs. Years of Experience
A scatterplot was used to investigate the association between salary and years of experience. This graph depicts how employee pay change based on their level of experience.

# Linear Regression: 
A linear regression model was used to estimate earnings based on years of experience. The dataset was divided into training and test sets (80% training, 20% test), and a linear regression model was constructed using the training data. The model's performance on the test set was assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
## Code Execution Instructions:
